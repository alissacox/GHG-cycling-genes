# GHG-cycling-genes
Pipeline to analyze functional gene amplicons from Illumina Miseq runs with QIIME 2 and other commandline tools - from n00bs for n00bs

The raw sequence reads for this analysis can be found in the Raw_Illumina_Seq_Reads [https://github.com/alissacox/GHG-cycling-genes/tree/master/Raw_Illumina_Seq_Reads] folder.

The QIIME2 folder contains separate pages for the script required to run all analyses in QIIME2, directions & script to create a custom database from NCBI fasta files (since only 16S/18S is 'premade' for QIIME2 users and there was little detail available on the on how to actually do this), and directions & script to use the Entrez Direct E-Utils commandline tool to make a QIIME2 compatible taxonomy file for import into QIIME2.
